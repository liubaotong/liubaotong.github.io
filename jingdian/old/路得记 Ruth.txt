路得记 Ruth


当士师秉政的时候，国中遭遇饥荒，在犹大伯利恒，有一个人带着妻子和两个儿子，往摩押地去寄居。
Now there came a time, in the days of the judges, when there was no food in the land. And a certain man went from Beth-lehem-judah, he and his wife and his two sons, to make a living-place in the country of Moab.

这人名叫以利米勒，他的妻名叫拿俄米。他两个儿子，一个名叫玛伦，一个名叫基连，都是犹大伯利恒的以法他人。他们到了摩押地，就住在那里。
And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and were there for some time.

后来拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒死了，剩下妇人和她两个儿子。
And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, came to his end; and only her two sons were with her.

这两个儿子娶了摩押女子为妻，一个名叫俄珥巴，一个名叫路得，在那里住了约有十年。
And they took two women of Moab as their wives: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they went on living there for about ten years.

玛伦和基连二人也死了，剩下拿俄米，没有丈夫，也没有儿子。
And Mahlon and Chilion came to their end; and the woman was without her two sons and her husband.

她就与两个儿妇起身，要从摩押地归回。因为她在摩押地，听见耶和华眷顾自己的百姓，赐粮食与他们。
So she and her daughters-in-law got ready to go back from the country of Moab, for news had come to her in the country of Moab that the Lord, in mercy for his people, had given them food.

于是她和两个儿妇起行离开所住的地方，要回犹大地去。
And she went out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah.

拿俄米对两个儿妇说，你们各人回娘家去吧，愿耶和华恩待你们，象你们恩待已死的人与我一样。
And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go back to your mothers' houses: may the Lord be good to you as you have been good to the dead and to me:

愿耶和华使你们各在新夫家中得平安。于是，拿俄米与她们亲嘴。她们就放声而哭，
May the Lord give you rest in the houses of your husbands. Then she gave them a kiss; and they were weeping bitterly.

说，不然，我们必与你一同回你本国去。
And they said to her, No, but we will go back with you to your people.

拿俄米说，我女儿们哪，回去吧，为何要跟我去呢？我还能生子作你们的丈夫吗？
But Naomi said, Go back, my daughters; why will you come with me? Have I more sons in my body, to become your husbands?

我女儿们哪，回去吧，我年纪老迈，不能再有丈夫。即或说，我还有指望，今夜有丈夫可以生子。
Go back, my daughters, and go on your way; I am so old now that I may not have another husband. If I said, I have hopes, if I had a husband tonight, and might have sons,

你们岂能等着他们长大呢？你们岂能等着他们不嫁别人呢？我女儿们哪，不要这样，我为你们的缘故，甚是愁苦，因为耶和华伸手攻击我。
Would you keep yourselves till they were old enough? would you keep from having husbands for them? No, my daughters; but I am very sad for you that the hand of the Lord is against me.

两个儿妇又放声而哭，俄珥巴与婆婆亲嘴而别，只是路得舍不得拿俄米。
Then again they were weeping; and Orpah gave her mother-in-law a kiss, but Ruth would not be parted from her.

拿俄米说，看哪，你嫂子已经回她本国，和她所拜的神那里去了，你也跟着你嫂子回去吧。
And Naomi said, See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods: go back after your sister-in-law.

路得说，不要催我回去不跟随你，你往哪里去，我也往哪里去。你在哪里住宿，我也在哪里住宿。你的国就是我的国，你的神就是我的神。
But Ruth said, Give up requesting me to go away from you, or to go back without you: for where you go I will go; and where you take your rest I will take my rest; your people will be my people, and your God my God.

你在哪里死，我也在哪里死，也葬在那里。除非死能使你我相离，不然，愿耶和华重重地降罚与我。
Wherever death comes to you, death will come to me, and there will be my last resting-place; the Lord do so to me and more if we are parted by anything but death.

拿俄米见路得定意要跟随自己去，就不再劝她了。
And when she saw that Ruth was strong in her purpose to go with her she said no more.

于是二人同行，来到伯利恒。她们到了伯利恒，合城的人就都惊讶。妇女们说，这是拿俄米吗？
So the two of them went on till they came to Beth-lehem. And when they came to Beth-lehem all the town was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

拿俄米对他们说，不要叫我拿俄米（拿俄米就是甜的意思），要叫我玛拉（玛拉就是苦的意思），因为全能者使我受了大苦。
And she said to them, Do not let my name be Naomi, but Mara, for the Ruler of all has given me a bitter fate.

我满满的出去，耶和华使我空空的回来。耶和华降祸与我，全能者使我受苦，既是这样，你们为何还叫我拿俄米呢？
I went out full, and the Lord has sent me back again with nothing; why do you give me the name Naomi, seeing that the Lord has given witness against me, and the Ruler of all has sent sorrow on me?

拿俄米和她儿妇摩押女子路得，从摩押地回来到伯利恒，正是动手割大麦的时候。
So Naomi came back out of the country of Moab, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her; and they came to Beth-lehem in the first days of the grain-cutting.

拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒的亲族中，有一个人名叫波阿斯，是个大财主。
And Naomi had a relation of her husband, a man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

摩押女子路得对拿俄米说，容我往田间去，我蒙谁的恩，就在谁的身后拾取麦穗。拿俄米说，女儿阿，你只管去。
And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Now let me go into the field and take up the heads of grain after him in whose eyes I may have grace. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.

路得就去了，来到田间，在收割的人身后拾取麦穗。她恰巧到了以利米勒本族的人，波阿斯那块田里。
And she went, and came and took up the heads of grain in the field after the cutters; and by chance she went into that part of the field which was the property of Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.

波阿斯正从伯利恒来，对收割的人说，愿耶和华与你们同在。他们回答说，愿耶和华赐福与你。
And Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said to the grain-cutters, The Lord be with you. And they made answer, The Lord give you his blessing.

波阿斯问监管收割的仆人说，那是谁家的女子。
Then Boaz said to his servant who was in authority over the cutters, Whose girl is this?

监管收割的仆人回答说，是那摩押女子，跟随拿俄米从摩押地回来的。
And the servant who was in authority over the cutters said, It is a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab;

她说，请你容我跟着收割的人，拾取打捆剩下的麦穗，她从早晨直到如今，除了在屋子里坐一会儿，常在这里。
And she said to me, Let me come into the grain-field and take up the grain after the cutters. So she came, and has been here from morning till now, without resting even for a minute.

波阿斯对路得说，女儿阿，听我说，不要往别人田里拾取麦穗，也不要离开这里，要常与我使女们在一处。
Then said Boaz to Ruth, Give ear to me, my daughter: do not go to take up the grain in another field, or go away from here, but keep here by my young women:

我的仆人在那块田收割，你就跟着他们去。我已经吩咐仆人不可欺负你。你若渴了，就可以到器皿那里喝仆人打来的水。
Keep your eyes on the field they are cutting, and go after them; have I not given orders to the young men not to put a hand on you? And when you are in need of drink go to the vessels and take of what the young men have put there.

路得就俯伏在地叩拜，对他说，我既是外邦人，怎么蒙你的恩，这样顾恤我呢？
Then she went down on her face to the earth, and said to him, Why have I grace in your eyes, that you give attention to me, seeing I am from a strange people?

波阿斯回答说，自从你丈夫死后，凡你向婆婆所行的，并你离开父母和本地，到素不认识的民中，这些事人全都告诉我了。
And Boaz answering said to her, I have had news of everything you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband; how you went away from your father and mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people who are strange to you.

愿耶和华照你所行的赏赐你。你来投靠耶和华以色列神的翅膀下，愿你满得他的赏赐。
The Lord give you a reward for what you have done, and may a full reward be given to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take cover.

路得说，我主阿，愿在你眼前蒙恩。我虽然不及你的一个使女，你还用慈爱的话安慰我的心。
Then she said, May I have grace in your eyes, my lord, for you have given me comfort, and you have said kind words to your servant, though I am not like one of your servants.

到了吃饭的时候，波阿斯对路得说，你到这里来吃饼，将饼蘸在醋里。路得就在收割的人旁边坐下，他们把烘了的穗子递给她。她吃饱了，还有余剩的。
And at meal-time Boaz said to her, Come here, and take some of the bread, and put your bit into the wine. And she took her seat among the grain-cutters: and he gave her dry grain, and she took it, and there was more than enough for her meal.

她起来又拾取麦穗，波阿斯吩咐仆人说，她就是在捆中拾取麦穗，也可以容她，不可羞辱她。
And when she got ready to take up the grain, Boaz gave his young men orders, saying, Let her take it even from among the cut grain, and say nothing to her.

并要从捆里抽出些来，留在地下任她拾取，不可叱吓她。
And let some heads of grain be pulled out of what has been corded up, and dropped for her to take, and let no sharp word be said to her.

这样，路得在田间拾取麦穗，直到晚上，将所拾取的打了，约有一伊法大麦。
So she went on getting together the heads of grain till evening; and after crushing out the seed it came to about an ephah of grain.

她就把所拾取的带进城去给婆婆看，又把她吃饱了所剩的给了婆婆。
And she took it up and went into the town; and she let her mother-in-law see what she had got, and after taking enough for herself she gave her the rest.

婆婆问她说，你今日在哪里拾取麦穗，在哪里做工呢？愿那顾恤你的得福。路得就告诉婆婆说，我今日在一个名叫波阿斯的人那里做工。
And her mother-in-law said to her, Where did you take up the grain today, and where were you working? May a blessing be on him who gave such attention to you. And she gave her mother-in-law an account of where she had been working, and said, The name of the man with whom I was working today is Boaz.

拿俄米对儿妇说，愿那人蒙耶和华赐福，因为他不断地恩待活人死人。拿俄米又说，那是我们本族的人，是一个至近的亲属。
And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, May the blessing of the Lord, who has at all times been kind to the living and to the dead, be on him. And Naomi said to her, The man is of our family, one of our near relations.

摩押女子路得说，他对我说，你要紧随我的仆人拾取麦穗，直等他们收完了我的庄稼。
And Ruth the Moabitess said, Truly, he said to me, Keep near my young men till all my grain is cut.

拿俄米对儿妇路得说，女儿阿，你跟着他的使女出去，不叫人遇见你在别人田间，这才为好。
And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, It is better, my daughter, for you to go out with his servant-girls, so that no danger may come to you in another field.

于是路得与波阿斯的使女常在一处拾取麦穗，直到收完了大麦和小麦。路得仍与婆婆同住。
So she kept near the servant-girls of Boaz to take up the grain till the cutting of the early grain and the cutting of the late grain were ended; and she went on living with her mother-in-law.

路得的婆婆拿俄米对她说，女儿阿，我不当为你找个安身之处，使你享福吗？
And Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, My daughter, am I not to get you a resting-place where you may be in comfort?

你与波阿斯的使女常在一处，波阿斯不是我们的亲族吗？他今夜在场上簸大麦，
And now, is there not Boaz, our relation, with whose young women you were? See, tonight he is separating the grain from the waste in his grain-floor.

你要沐浴抹膏，换上衣服，下到场上，却不要使那人认出你来。你等他吃喝完了，
So take a bath, and, after rubbing your body with sweet oil, put on your best robe, and go down to the grain-floor; but do not let him see you till he has come to the end of his meal.

到他睡的时候，你看准他睡的地方，就进去掀开他脚上的被，躺卧在那里，他必告诉你所当做的事。
But see to it, when he goes to rest, that you take note of the place where he is sleeping, and go in there, and, uncovering his feet, take your place by him; and he will say what you are to do.

路得说，凡你所吩咐的，我必遵行。
And she said, I will do all you say.

路得就下到场上，照她婆婆所吩咐她的而行。
So she went down to the grain-floor and did all her mother-in-law had said to her.

波阿斯吃喝完了，心里欢畅，就去睡在麦堆旁边。路得便悄悄地来掀开他脚上的被，躺卧在那里。
Now when Boaz had taken meat and drink, and his heart was glad, he went to take his rest at the end of the mass of grain; then she came softly and, uncovering his feet, went to rest.

到了夜半，那人忽然惊醒，翻过身来，不料有女子躺在他的脚下。
Now in the middle of the night, the man awaking from his sleep in fear, and lifting himself up, saw a woman stretched at his feet.

他就说，你是谁。回答说，我是你的婢女路得。求你用你的衣襟遮盖我，因为你是我一个至近的亲属。
And he said, Who are you? And she answering said, I am your servant Ruth: take your servant as wife, for you are a near relation.

波阿斯说，女儿阿，愿你蒙耶和华赐福。你末后的恩比先前更大。因为少年人无论贫富，你都没有跟从。
And he said, May the Lord give you his blessing, my daughter: even better than what you did at the first is this last kind act you have done, in not going after young men, with or without wealth.

女儿阿，现在不要惧怕，凡你所说的，我必照着行。我本城的人都知道你是个贤德的女子。
And now, my daughter, have no fear; I will do for you whatever you say: for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue.

我实在是你一个至近的亲属，只是还有一个人比我更近。
Now it is true that I am a near relation: but there is a relation nearer than I.

你今夜在这里住宿，明早他若肯为你尽亲属的本分。就由他吧。倘若不肯，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我必为你尽了本分，你只管躺到天亮。
Take your rest here tonight; and in the morning, if he will do for you what it is right for a relation to do, very well, let him do so: but if he will not, then by the living Lord I myself will do so.

路得便在他脚下躺到天快亮。人彼此不能辨认的时候就起来了。波阿斯说，不可使人知道有女子到场上来。
And she took her rest at his feet till the morning: and she got up before it was light enough for one to see another. And he said, Let it not come to anyone's knowledge that the woman came to the grain-floor.

又对路得说，打开你所披的外衣。她打开了，波阿斯就撮了六簸箕大麦，帮她扛在肩上，她便进城去了。
And he said, Take your robe, stretching it out in your hands: and she did so, and he took six measures of grain and put them into it, and gave it her to take: and she went back to the town.

路得回到婆婆那里，婆婆说，女儿阿，怎么样了。路得就将那人向她所行的述说了一遍。
And when she came back her mother-in-law said to her, How did it go with you, my daughter? And she gave her an account of all the man had done to her.

又说，那人给了我六簸箕大麦，对我说，你不可空手回去见你的婆婆。
And she said, He gave me these six measures of grain, saying, Do not go back to your mother-in-law with nothing in your hands.

婆婆说，女儿阿，你只管安坐等候，看这事怎样成就，因为那人今日不办成这事必不休息。
Then she said, Do nothing now, my daughter, till you see what will come of this; for the man will take no rest till he has put this thing through.

波阿斯到了城门，坐在那里，恰巧波阿斯所说的那至近的亲属经过。波阿斯说，某人哪，你来坐在这里。他就来坐下。
And Boaz went up to the public place of the town, and took his seat there: and the near relation of whom he had been talking came by; and Boaz, crying out to him by name, said, Come and be seated here. And he came and was seated.

波阿斯又从本城的长老中拣选了十人，对他们说，请你们坐在这里。他们就都坐下。
Then he got ten of the responsible men of the town, and said, Be seated here. And they took their seats.

波阿斯对那至近的亲属说，从摩押地回来的拿俄米，现在要卖我们族兄以利米勒的那块地。
Then he said to the near relation, Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for a price that bit of land which was our brother Elimelech's:

我想当赎那块地的是你，其次是我，以外再没有别人了。你可以在这里的人面前，和我本国的长老面前说明，你若肯赎就赎，若不肯赎就告诉我。那人回答说，我肯赎。
And it was in my mind to give you the chance of taking it, with the approval of those seated here and of the responsible men of my people. If you are ready to do what it is right for a relation to do, then do it: but if you will not do it, say so to me now; for there is no one who has the right to do it but you, and after you myself. And he said, I will do it.

波阿斯说，你从拿俄米手中买这地的时候，也当娶（原文作买十节同）死人的妻摩押女子路得，使死人在产业上存留他的名。
Then Boaz said, On the day when you take this field, you will have to take with it Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, so that you may keep the name of the dead living in his heritage.

那人说，这样我就不能赎了，恐怕于我的产业有碍。你可以赎我所当赎的，我不能赎了。
And the near relation said, I am not able to do the relation's part, for fear of damaging the heritage I have: you may do it in my place, for I am not able to do it myself.

从前，在以色列中要定夺什么事，或赎回，或交易，这人就脱鞋给那人。以色列人都以此为证据。
Now, in earlier times this was the way in Israel when property was taken over by a near relation, or when there was a change of owner. To make the exchange certain one man took off his shoe and gave it to the other; and this was a witness in Israel.

那人对波阿斯说，你自己买吧。于是将鞋脱下来了。
So the near relation said to Boaz, Take it for yourself. And he took off his shoe.

波阿斯对长老和众民说，你们今日作见证，凡属以利米勒和基连，玛伦的，我都从拿俄米手中置买了。
Then Boaz said to the responsible men and to all the people, You are witnesses today that I have taken at a price from Naomi all the property which was Elimelech's, and everything which was Chilion's and Mahlon's.

又娶了玛伦的妻摩押女子路得为妻，好在死人的产业上存留他的名，免得他的名在本族本乡灭没。你们今日可以作见证。
And, further, I have taken Ruth, the Moabitess, who was the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, to keep the name of the dead man living in his heritage, so that his name may not be cut off from among his countrymen, and from the memory of his town: you are witnesses this day.

在城门坐着的众民和长老都说，我们作见证。愿耶和华使进你家的这女子，像建立以色列家的拉结，利亚二人一样。又愿你在以法他得亨通，在伯利恒得名声。
And all the people who were in the public place, and the responsible men, said, We are witnesses. May the Lord make this woman, who is about to come into your house, like Rachel and Leah, which two were the builders of the house of Israel: and may you have wealth in Ephrathah, and be great in Beth-lehem;

愿耶和华从这少年女子赐你后裔，使你的家像他玛，从犹大所生法勒斯的家一般。
May your family be like the family of Perez, the son whom Tamar gave to Judah, from the offspring which the Lord may give you by this young woman.

于是，波阿斯娶了路得为妻，与她同房。耶和华使她怀孕生了一个儿子。
So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the Lord made her with child and she gave birth to a son.

妇人们对拿俄米说，耶和华是应当称颂的。因为今日没有撇下你使你无至近的亲属。愿这孩子在以色列中得名声。
And the women said to Naomi, A blessing on the Lord, who has not let you be this day without a near relation, and may his name be great in Israel.

他必提起你的精神，奉养你的老，因为是爱慕你的那儿妇所生的。有这儿妇比有七个儿子还好。
He will be a giver of new life to you, and your comforter when you are old, for your daughter-in-law, who, in her love for you, is better than seven sons, has given birth to him.

拿俄米就把孩子抱在怀中，作他的养母。
And Naomi took the child and put her arms round it, and she took care of it.

邻舍的妇人说，拿俄米得孩子了。就给孩子起名叫俄备得。这俄备得是耶西的父，耶西是大卫的父。
And the women who were her neighbours gave it a name, saying, Naomi has a child; and they gave him the name of Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.

法勒斯的后代，记在下面。法勒斯生希斯仑。
Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron;

希斯仑生兰，兰生亚米拿达。
And Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab;

亚米拿达生拿顺，拿顺生撒门。
And Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon;

撒门生波阿斯，波阿斯生俄备得。
And Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed;

俄备得生耶西，耶西生大卫。
And Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.

��生波阿斯，波阿斯生俄备得。
And Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed;

俄备得生耶西，耶西生大卫。
And Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.
